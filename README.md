# Virus Dodge

This is an HTML/Javascript remake of a game I made in 2014 using scratch.mit.edu. Made using Cursor AI IDE as a fun project.

Original game: https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/27853178/

## How to Play

1. Open `index.html` in your web browser
2. Click "Start Game" to begin
3. Use WASD keys or arrow keys to move the blue player character
4. Avoid the green viruses that spawn from the edges
5. Try to survive as long as possible!

## Features

- **Top-down 2D view** with keyboard controls (WASD/Arrow keys)
- **Green viruses** spawn randomly from all four edges and move towards the center
- **Real-time score** showing survival time in seconds
- **Explosion effect** when the player touches a virus
- **Animated "GAME OVER" text** with letters that turn green from left to right and back
- **Trollface animation** that appears 10 seconds after game over and moves clockwise around the screen
- **Try Again button** to restart the game
- **Modern UI** with good contrast and visibility

## Game Mechanics

- Viruses spawn at random intervals from the edges of the screen
- Each virus moves at a slightly different speed towards the center
- Viruses disappear when they reach the center area
- The player must avoid all viruses to survive
- Score is calculated based on survival time in seconds
